    "# Zero Shot Sentiment Analysis using LASER\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a notebook to show an example of how NLP methods can utilize data in another language to perform a task in Danish with no need for Danish data. Imagine a task where there is no annotated data in Danish but there exists open source dataset in another language for a similar task. In such a case it is sometimes possible to train a model on data from the so called 'source' language an imply it straight away on the 'target' language. This is called  **zero-shot transfer** when the classifier has not seen any data from the target language.\n",
    "\n",
    "The overall idea is to create a multilingual embedding space to represent words or sentences from several languages in a similar matter. This means that we can take a sentence in one language and map it into a vector representation which basically is an array of numbers. If we then have a sentence in another language with the same meaning, we can then map this sentence as well into the vector representation. This would ideally give us to arrays of numbers which are very similar. We can also think of it in a geometrically sense; these vectors lie close to each other in our multilingual embeddings space.\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea is now to map the annotated data in the source language into such representations. We can then use these representations as features and train a (simple) classification model. When we want to apply the model on the target language, we simply take the input sentences and map it into the representation and then apply the trained classifier.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example we will be working with  **LASER sentence embeddings** from Facebook Research. Have a look at their [github](https://github.com/facebookresearch/LASER) or read the paper for further understanding: Holger Schwenk and Matthijs Douze, [Learning Joint Multilingual Sentence Representations with Neural Machine Translation](https://aclweb.org/anthology/papers/W/W17/W17-2619/), ACL workshop on Representation Learning for NLP, 2017.\n",
    "The Laser embeddings are trained using machine translation on 93 languages using a shared encoder, and the data is different sets of parallel corpuses that translate into English and Spanish.\n",
    "\n",
    "The task we will look at in this example is **Sentiment Analyses** performed on data from movie reviews. We will be using the IMDB dataset for training, and then we will be testing on a Norwegian dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "*NOTE:\n",
    "The code in this notebook is not integrated in the DaNLP, but we are working on a Danish dataset for sentiment and with it a model for sentiment analyse, that is properly benchmarked*\n",
